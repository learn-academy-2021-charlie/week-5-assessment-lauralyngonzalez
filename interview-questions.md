# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean?

  Your answer: The MVC pattern stands for Model-View-Controller. The model is the data,
  the view is what's displayed to the user, and the controller handles the interaction between
  the view and the model so that the data gets displayed in the view, or the view sends data
  back to the database.

2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is a database where tables are connected by a relation. 
  For example, a database for a school could have two tables for teachers and students and
  each student has an ID for their current teacher. There are also non-relational databases
  like NoSQL that does not use relations to connect data.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys are unique IDs associated for each instance in a relational
  database. They are important because other columns could have duplicate information
  like if two people share the same first and last name. Primary keys are also used
  when a relation between two tables are made so that the primary key is becomes a
  foreign key in the other table.
